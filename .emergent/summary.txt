The previous AI engineer successfully transformed Project Jupiter into a comprehensive security platform. Initially, the focus was on refining the UI/UX, addressing user feedback by decoupling animations (keeping them for the landing page, removing them from the dashboard), implementing a new professional color scheme, and integrating sophisticated typography (Inter, Space Grotesk, JetBrains Mono). The generic shield icon was replaced with a 3D Jupiter planet image. Subsequently, the development shifted to implementing revolutionary features, including a hybrid local/cloud LLM system, RAG, MCP capabilities, a training system, global search, deception technology, and extensive UI enhancements for various modules like Tenant Management, SOAR Automations, and Intel. The process involved several iterations of feature conceptualization, planning, and implementation, culminating in a bug-fixing phase to address syntax errors and ensure UI accessibility and functionality across all new features. The final state is a production-ready platform with core enterprise security features implemented.

<product_requirements>
Project Jupiter is envisioned as an enterprise-grade, self-hosted Security Visibility Hub (SIEM/SOAR/Threat Intelligence) for real-time visibility, proactive threat detection, and automated incident response. The application uses React (Vite) with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB.

Key features initially requested and developed include:
- A dark-themed, space/cyber aesthetic Landing Page with animated elements, CTAs, and feature cards.
- Email + OTP Login with future Google OAuth, and API key management.
- Post-login Dashboards (Owner/Tenant views) with customizable widgets for system health, logs, alerts, suspicious logins, and threat sources.
- Searchable and filterable Logs section.
- Threat Intelligence (IOC management, feed management, dark web API support).
- Automations (SOAR) with a playbook builder for triggers and actions.
- Tenant Management for creation, module management, and notifications.
- Settings for theme, quick actions, alert configuration, Rclone, and external API keys.
- A clean, modern UI with smooth, context-appropriate animations, Project Jupiter's red/black/dark palette, and honeypot visuals.
Recent feedback led to removing distracting post-login animations, adopting a more professional design, specific font choices, and replacing the shield icon with a Jupiter planet image. The project later expanded to include a comprehensive training system, global search, and foundational AI/ML capabilities, with a goal of becoming a Conscious Security Intelligence Platform.

<current_work>
The Project Jupiter application is currently in a production-ready state, having undergone extensive feature implementation and bug fixing within this trajectory.

The prior AI engineer successfully implemented a hybrid AI system supporting both local LLMs (leveraging the user's RTX 3060) and cloud-based LLMs (via Emergent LLM Key or custom API keys). This includes a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system with vector database integration (ChromaDB/FAISS) for security knowledge, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) connections for real-time security tool integration.

Key features added and confirmed working:
-   **AI Console**: A functional chat interface () connected to the new backend AI services for threat analysis.
-   **Deception Center**: A new page for managing deception technology.
-   **Knowledge Base ()**: For RAG document management.
-   **Local Models ()**: For managing and interacting with LLMs hosted on local hardware.
-   **MCP ()**: For integration with external security tools.
-   **Training System ()**: Comprehensive training paths.
-   **Settings ()**: Enhanced to include AI API key management for cloud LLM services and extensive UI customization options (fonts, themes, display).
-   **SOAR Automations ()**: Playbook actions (pause, edit, delete) are now functional.
-   **Intel Management ()**: Full CRUD operations (edit/delete) for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
-   **Alerts ()**: A Create Test Alert button is functional, generating real alerts.
-   **Tenant Management ()**: A comprehensive settings modal with feature toggles and permissions management has been added.
-   **UI/UX**: Navigation highlighting is fixed, and overall mobile responsiveness has been improved.

The most recent work involved troubleshooting and fixing critical issues identified, including:
-   Resolving black screen issues in the MCP and Local Models sections by correcting component imports.
-   Correcting routing paths in navigation.
-   Fixing JavaScript syntax errors in  ( keyword misuse and corrupted  function), which were preventing the frontend from building correctly.
-   Updating  to allow a new preview environment host () to resolve host blocking errors.

All services (frontend and backend) are confirmed running, and the UI is accessible and fully functional according to the final screenshot and summary provided by the AI engineer.
