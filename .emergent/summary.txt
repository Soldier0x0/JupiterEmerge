The AI engineer successfully built Project Jupiter, an enterprise-grade SIEM/SOAR platform, from scratch, achieving a functional MVP. The approach involved a structured full-stack development, prioritizing backend APIs with FastAPI and MongoDB, followed by a React frontend with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui. Key challenges included environment setup with supervisor, resolving Python dependency issues (), fixing frontend startup scripts (yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. vs ), and crucial configuration adjustments for preview environments (Vite , relative API paths). The engineer also tackled  browser context issues and implemented a temporary OTP display in the UI for ease of testing. Comprehensive testing confirmed backend API functionality and frontend rendering. The engineer focused on meeting the core product requirements, demonstrating problem-solving capabilities to ensure the application was runnable and accessible. The current state is a functional application awaiting refinement based on recent user feedback regarding UI animations and an external code review.

<product_requirements>
Project Jupiter aims to be an enterprise-grade, self-hosted Security Visibility Hub, integrating SIEM, SOAR, and threat intelligence. The vision is to offer real-time visibility, proactive threat detection, and automation-driven incident response, balancing simplicity for small teams with advanced configurations for experts. The tech stack specifies React (Next.js), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, shadcn/ui for frontend, Node/Express or Next.js APIs for backend, and MongoDB (OpenSearch for logs).

Key features developed so far or requested include:
- **Landing Page**: Dark-themed with space/cyber aesthetic, Secure. Isolate. Visualize. tagline, animated logo, Launch Console, Get Started buttons, feature cards, interactive FAQ, and footer.
- **Login Experience**: Email + OTP authentication (no passwords initially), with future support for Google OAuth. Focus on security, simplicity, responsiveness, and accessibility. User explicitly requested API keys to be entered via UI and saved in DB.
- **Post-login Dashboards**: Owner view (system health, logs ingested, alerts, suspicious logins, top alert sources, recent threats, multi-tenant summary) and Tenant view (scoped metrics like their own suspicious logins, alerts triggered, IOC matches, top alert sources). Widgets should be resizable/customizable.
- **Logs Section**: Searchable, filterable table (date/time, source, severity), export to JSON/CSV, pagination.
- **Threat Intelligence**: IOC upload/tagging, IOC query across logs, feed enable/disable per tenant, honeycomb visual theme, dark web API support (VirusTotal, LeakIX, DeHashed).
- **Automations (SOAR)**: Build-your-own playbooks with triggers (High Severity Alert, IOC Match, Regex Match) and actions (Send Email, Block IP, Tag Alert, Open Case). Timeline-style builder UI, previews, save/delete.
- **Tenant Management**: Admin UI for creating tenants, enabling/disabling modules, email notifications, CSV import for bulk onboarding, future API-based onboarding and Tenant Admin role.
- **Settings**: Theme/layout customization, quick actions, alert configuration, Rclone settings for backup, API keys for external integrations (explicitly requested to be saved in DB).
- **UX/UI Expectations**: Clean, modern, polished UI (premium Android/Apple feel), smooth animations, avoid bloat, Project Jupiter's red/black/dark palette, honeypot visual elements.
- **Current Feedback**: Animations once logged in are too distracting. User provided a  generated code example (, , ) for review.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React.js (Vite) frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, PostCSS.
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui, Lucide-react for icons.
- **Authentication**: Email + OTP system.
- **Process Management**: Supervisor for running frontend and backend services.
- **Environment Variables**: Strict usage (, ) via  (frontend) and  (backend).
- **API Routing**: Backend routes prefixed with  for Kubernetes ingress.

<code_architecture>
The application has a clear separation between frontend and backend, orchestrated by supervisor.



-   ****: Lists Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend. Was modified to include necessary packages like To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]", , , , , , , , , .
-   ****: Stores environment variables specific to the backend, notably . Was created.
-   ****: The main FastAPI application file. It was heavily rewritten to include API endpoints for user authentication (register, request OTP, login, logout), dashboard data, health checks, and API key management. Initial import issues related to  were addressed by simplification.
-   ****: Defines Node.js dependencies and scripts for the React frontend. Was updated to include , , , , , , , , , , , , , . The  script was changed to  for development.
-   ****: Vite configuration file. Modified to include  for external preview access (e.g., ) and proxy settings for API calls.
-   ****: Stores frontend environment variables, primarily  (previously ). Updated to align with Vite's naming convention and ensure correct backend URL usage.
-   ****: The main React component that handles routing. It was significantly updated to define routes for all major application sections (Login, Register, Home, Alerts, Intel, Automations, Settings, TenantManagement, Explore, Entities, Models, Logs, Cases) and integrate the .
-   ****: Centralized utility for making API calls to the backend. Modified to use  to correctly access environment variables in the browser context, resolving process is not defined errors.
-   ****: Provides authentication context to the React application, managing user login state and token.
-   ****: The component for the public landing page, displaying branding, hero section, CTAs, and feature cards, adhering to the dark-themed space/cyber aesthetic.
-   ** & **: Navigation components, likely updated to reflect the new application structure and routes.
-   ****: A large number of new page components (, ,  (Dashboard), , , , , , , , , , ) were created or heavily modified to implement the various features as per the requirements, including UI elements and API integrations.
-   ****: A reusable UI component, likely used across the application for consistent styling of content blocks.
-   ****: Supervisor configuration file. Modified to correctly run the frontend (yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.) and backend (). This ensures both services start and run in the background.

<current_work>
The Project Jupiter application is currently a functional MVP, having gone through several iterations of development and bug fixes.
The backend, running on FastAPI, handles user authentication (registration, OTP request, login, logout), API key management, and serves dashboard data. It successfully validates user credentials and issues JWT tokens upon successful login.
The frontend, a React application using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, presents a dark-themed, space/cyber aesthetic. It features:
-   A fully rendered landing page with core branding, CTAs (Launch Console, Get Started), and feature cards.
-   A two-step login/registration flow using email and tenant ID, followed by an OTP.
-   For testing purposes, a temporary development feature has been added to display the OTP directly in the browser message after it's sent, eliminating the need to check backend logs.
-   The core SIEM/SOAR features such as Dashboard, Settings (for API key entry), Threat Intelligence, Automations, Alerts, Cases, and Tenant Management pages have been implemented.
-   Connectivity between the frontend and backend is established, with API calls correctly routed via a proxy and environment variables ().
-   Critical issues like  errors in the browser context and Vite's  configuration for external preview access have been resolved, ensuring the application is accessible and functional in the preview environment.
-   Both backend and frontend services are successfully running via Supervisor.
The immediate focus before this summary was reviewing the user's feedback about distracting animations and analyzing the provided  code snippets for potential integration or design inspiration.
