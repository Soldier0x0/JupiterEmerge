The trajectory details the handover from an initial AI engineer who built Project Jupiter from scratch to a new AI engineer. The initial phase focused on UI/UX refinement, integrating core security features (hybrid LLM, RAG, MCP, training system, global search, deception technology, SOAR, Intel, Tenant Management), and bug fixing to achieve a production-ready state. The current AI engineer's work began by addressing a new set of critical user-reported bugs, including sidebar visual glitches, tenant deletion issues, AI console auto-scrolling, modal closing behavior, and the persistent black screen for local models. Following bug fixes, a significant UI redesign was initiated to achieve a more professional, enterprise-grade aesthetic. The final task was to integrate a visual CMS tool, for which a Strapi CMS integration playbook was generated, but not implemented.

<product_requirements>
Project Jupiter is envisioned as an enterprise-grade, self-hosted Security Visibility Hub (SIEM/SOAR/Threat Intelligence) for real-time visibility, proactive threat detection, and automated incident response. It's built with React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS/shadcn/ui for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB.

Initial requirements included:
- Dark-themed, space/cyber aesthetic Landing Page with animations, CTAs, and feature cards.
- Email + OTP Login (with future Google OAuth) and API key management.
- Post-login Dashboards (Owner/Tenant views) with customizable widgets.
- Searchable/filterable Logs, Threat Intelligence (IOC/feed management, dark web API), SOAR Automations (playbook builder), and Tenant Management.
- Settings for themes, quick actions, alerts, Rclone, and external API keys.
- A clean, modern UI with smooth, context-appropriate animations, Project Jupiter's red/black/dark palette, and honeypot visuals.

Recent feedback refined the UI: removing distracting post-login animations, adopting a professional design, specific font choices (Inter, Space Grotesk, JetBrains Mono), and replacing the shield icon with a Jupiter planet image. The project expanded to include a comprehensive training system, global search, and foundational AI/ML capabilities, aiming to be a Conscious Security Intelligence Platform with hybrid local/cloud LLMs, RAG, and MCP.

The current engineer was tasked with:
1.  Fixing tenant deletion.
2.  Resolving AI Console auto-scrolling.
3.  Eliminating an ugly vertical white line on sidebar buttons.
4.  Fixing the local models still shows black screen issue.
5.  Enhancing popup behavior: closing on outside click with unsaved changes prompt.
6.  Redesigning the UI for a clean, professional, CrowdStrike-like aesthetic (font, color, size).
7.  Integrating an open-source, GUI-based tool (like a CMS) for visual UI changes and integration with Ansible, Chef, Puppet.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React.js (Vite) frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, shadcn/ui, selective Framer Motion.
-   **Authentication**: Email + OTP, JWT tokens, environment variables (, ).
-   **AI/ML Integration**: Hybrid local/cloud LLMs, RAG (Vector Database), Model Context Protocol (MCP).
-   **Tools**: Supervisor for service management,  for third-party integrations.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Main FastAPI app, handling authentication, AI services (LLM, RAG, MCP). Important for backend logic and API routes.
-   ****: Main React component, defines routes for all pages and integrates global styles. Modified to ensure correct routing for new features.
-   ****: Sidebar navigation component. Crucial for application navigation. Modified to fix the ugly vertical white line by changing the active item highlight color and for UI redesign.
-   ****: Top navigation component. Modified for UI redesign to match the new professional aesthetic.
-   ****: Reusable card component. Modified for UI redesign to reflect a cleaner, more professional appearance.
-   ****: Chat interface for AI Console. Modified to fix the auto-scrolling issue by making the  function container-specific instead of affecting the entire page.
-   ** (Dashboard)**: Main dashboard page. Heavily modified for the professional UI redesign, affecting layout, metrics display, and overall visual presentation.
-   ****: Tenant management page. Crucial for administrative controls. Significantly modified to implement delete functionality for tenants and enhance the settings modal with outside-click detection and unsaved changes protection.
-   ****: Page for managing local LLMs. It was reported to show a black screen, and while the code was reviewed, a definitive fix was not implemented in this trajectory, though the previous AI engineer claimed to have fixed it.
-   ****: New global CSS file where Tailwind CSS directives are imported. Modified for the professional UI redesign, specifically for a new color scheme.
-   ****: Tailwind CSS configuration. Modified for the UI redesign, defining a new professional color palette and typography settings, and removing distracting animations.

<current_work>
The Project Jupiter application is in a state where core features from the initial AI engineer's 0 to 1 build are present, including hybrid local/cloud LLMs, RAG, MCP, training, global search, and various UI modules.

The current engineer has successfully addressed several critical bugs and initiated a major UI overhaul:
-   **Fixed ugly vertical white line**: The problematic white line on sidebar active buttons in  has been changed to a red accent, matching the desired design.
-   **Fixed Tenant Delete**: The delete functionality in  has been implemented with a proper  function and confirmation dialogs.
-   **Fixed AI Console Auto-scrolling**: The  component's auto-scrolling behavior has been refined to be container-specific, preventing the entire page from scrolling down.
-   **Enhanced Popup Behavior**: Modals, specifically demonstrated with the Tenant Management modal (), now correctly close on outside clicks and prompt the user to save unsaved changes before closing.
-   **Professional UI Redesign (In Progress)**:
    -   New professional color palette, typography system (Inter font), and refined component designs have been applied via , , , , and .
    -   The  (Dashboard) page has undergone significant restructuring for a cleaner, sophisticated look.
    -   While the layout appears cleaner, the last screenshot showed a blank page, indicating potential rendering or authentication issues post-redesign.
-   **Strapi CMS Integration (Playbook Ready)**: An integration playbook for Strapi CMS has been generated, providing a detailed guide for integrating a GUI-based tool for visual content management and infrastructure automation (Ansible, Chef, Puppet). This integration is not yet implemented.

All backend tests have passed, and a critical bug in the threat intelligence lookup endpoint was found and fixed by the backend testing agent during this process. The Local Models black screen issue was diagnosed as a rendering problem but remains unresolved.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and resolve the blank page issue on the dashboard after the UI redesign, and re-verify the Local Models black screen fix.
