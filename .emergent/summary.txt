<analysis>
Project Jupiter has undergone significant evolution, transforming from an MVP to a robust enterprise security platform. The development journey focused on three key phases: stabilization, enhancement, and feature expansion. Initially, critical issues were addressed, including dashboard rendering, authentication flows, and UI glitches. A comprehensive UI redesign established a professional, enterprise-grade aesthetic. The platform then saw major feature implementations, including a sophisticated drag-and-drop dashboard system and a comprehensive RBAC implementation with five-tier role hierarchy. While certain initiatives like Google OAuth were explored and reverted per user request, and Strapi CMS integration was deferred, the platform has maintained steady progress. The current focus is on extending the platform's capabilities with 2FA/SSO integration and advanced AI features, building upon the stable foundation of core security and administration features.
