The trajectory chronicles the transition of Project Jupiter's development from an initial AI engineer to a new one, focusing on refining an MVP-level application. The primary objectives involved critical bug fixes and significant UI/UX improvements, followed by feature expansion. Key challenges included a blank dashboard, authentication issues, and a black screen on local models, all of which were successfully diagnosed and resolved through methodical code inspection, temporary bypasses, and targeted fixes. A major UI redesign was implemented, transforming the aesthetic to an enterprise-grade look. Subsequently, the engineer began integrating new features. An attempt at Google OAuth was initiated and then explicitly reverted by user request. The Strapi CMS integration playbook was generated but not implemented, deferring the full setup due to complexity. The engineer then successfully implemented a comprehensive drag-and-drop dashboard customization system. The current phase involves generating playbooks and initiating work on advanced security features like 2FA, SSO, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), demonstrating a clear progression from stabilization to functional enhancement.

<product_requirements>
Project Jupiter is envisioned as an enterprise-grade, self-hosted Security Visibility Hub (SIEM/SOAR/Threat Intelligence) for real-time visibility, proactive threat detection, and automated incident response, built with React (Vite), Tailwind CSS/shadcn/ui, FastAPI, and MongoDB. Initial requirements included a dark-themed landing page, email+OTP login with future Google OAuth, post-login dashboards (Owner/Tenant) with customizable widgets, searchable logs, threat intelligence, SOAR automations, and tenant management. UI feedback emphasized removing distracting animations, adopting a professional, CrowdStrike-like aesthetic, specific fonts (Inter, Space Grotesk, JetBrains Mono), and a Jupiter planet icon. The project expanded to a Conscious Security Intelligence Platform with hybrid LLMs, RAG, and MCP, including a comprehensive training system and global search. The current engineer was specifically tasked with fixing tenant deletion, AI Console auto-scrolling, a sidebar visual glitch, local models black screen, enhancing popup behavior, redesigning the UI professionally, and integrating a GUI-based CMS tool like Strapi for visual UI changes and infrastructure automation.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>


-   ****: Main FastAPI app, handling authentication, AI services, and now tenant ID resolution.
    -   **Changes**: Added  endpoint to get tenant UUID from name. OAuth endpoints (, ) were added and subsequently removed.  was modified to support session tokens for OAuth, and reverted after OAuth removal.
-   ****: Main React component defining application routes.
    -   **Changes**: Routes were adjusted to include new pages ( - added, then removed) and modified paths for the  page (now ).
-   ****: Sidebar navigation component.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed ugly vertical white line by modifying active item highlight color for UI redesign.
-   ****: Top navigation component.
    -   **Changes**: Modified for UI redesign to match professional aesthetic.
-   ****: Reusable card component.
    -   **Changes**: Modified for UI redesign, reflecting cleaner professional appearance.
-   ****: Chat interface for AI Console.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed auto-scrolling issue by making  container-specific.
-   ****: Main dashboard page.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily modified for professional UI redesign, initially causing a blank screen. This file was updated to use the new  component. It also had a null check for  () added to prevent crashes.
-   ****: Tenant management page.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented delete functionality for tenants with confirmation dialogs. Enhanced settings modal to close on outside clicks and prompt for unsaved changes.
-   ****: Page for managing local LLMs.
    -   **Changes**: Fixed the black screen issue by resolving a variable naming conflict ( to ) that caused Cannot access before initialization error.
-   ****: Global CSS file for Tailwind directives.
    -   **Changes**: Added  specific styles and  keyframe for UI redesign.
-   ****: Tailwind CSS configuration.
    -   **Changes**: Defined new professional color palette, typography (Inter font), and removed distracting animations.
-   ****: Manages authentication state and context.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to incorporate  to resolve tenant names to UUIDs during login. Temporary  redirect and local storage mocking for debugging were added and then removed. OAuth related session handling was added and then removed.
-   ****: Login interface.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use resolved tenant ID instead of tenant name for OTP requests. OAuth login button and handler were added and then removed.
-   ****: Central API client.
    -   **Changes**: Added  API function to communicate with the new backend endpoint. OAuth specific API functions were added and then removed.  in the response interceptor was not directly changed but the redirect logic in  was addressed.
-   ****: **NEW** component for individual dashboard widgets.
    -   **Summary**: Created to encapsulate logic for rendering different widget types (metrics, status, progress, lists, charts) with basic styling and data display.
-   ****: **NEW** core component for drag-and-drop dashboard functionality.
    -   **Summary**: Implements  to provide customizable, drag-and-drop widgets. It manages widget states, adding/removing widgets, saving layouts to localStorage, and resetting.

<current_work>
Project Jupiter has transitioned from an initial 0 to 1 build to a stable, enhanced application. All critical user-reported bugs have been successfully resolved. The ugly vertical white line on the sidebar was fixed, tenant deletion functionality is robust, and AI Console auto-scrolling is corrected. The Local Models black screen issue was resolved by fixing a variable naming conflict in . The dashboard's blank page issue, primarily caused by a null reference error for user properties and initial CSS compilation issues, has been rectified. Authentication flow now works correctly, including resolving tenant names to UUIDs during login.

A significant UI redesign for a professional, enterprise-grade aesthetic has been implemented, refining the color palette, typography, and component designs. Distracting animations were removed, and the main  page now utilizes a newly implemented  component.

The application currently features a fully functional drag-and-drop dashboard customization system, allowing users to add, remove, and arrange various widgets (metrics, status, progress, lists, charts) with layout persistence via . The backend is stable, with all critical tests passing.

The plan to integrate Google OAuth was initiated and a playbook was generated, but the user explicitly requested its removal. A playbook for Strapi CMS integration has been generated, but the full implementation (requiring database migration to PostgreSQL and extensive configuration) has been deferred. The current focus is on implementing advanced security features, starting with 2FA/SSO and then moving to Advanced RBAC.
