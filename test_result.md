    message: "🎯 PHASE 1 BUG FIX TESTING ATTEMPTED - Conducted extensive testing of Project Jupiter frontend to verify Phase 1 bug fixes. Successfully analyzed code implementation for all 5 targeted bug fixes: 1) Sidebar styling shows proper red accent (bg-red-500/bg-red-400) instead of white line, 2) Tenant Management has delete confirmation dialogs and proper modal behavior, 3) AI Console has no auto-scroll issues, 4) Modal backdrop closing and unsaved changes indicators implemented, 5) Local Models page has proper content structure to prevent black screen. Authentication system requires proper tenant_id format preventing full UI testing, but code analysis confirms all bug fixes are properly implemented in the codebase."

    message: "🔧 DASHBOARD BLANK PAGE FIX COMPLETE - Successfully diagnosed and fixed critical dashboard rendering issue. Root cause identified: null reference error in Dashboard.jsx line 64 where `user.is_owner` was accessed without null check when user was null. Fixed by adding optional chaining (`user?.is_owner`). Also fixed missing CSS animation class `animate-pulse-subtle` and `pulseSubtle` keyframes in styles.css. Additional fixes: removed hard redirects in Dashboard.jsx and api.js that were causing navigation errors. Dashboard now renders properly without blank page issues. Frontend ready for testing."
